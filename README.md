# DR-Detection

Diabetic Retinopahty, a condition of eye in which lesions are formed due to diabetes that can cause complete vision loss in severe cases. Hence CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) models are required to ease the diagonsotic process making it reliable and error free, a task most practictioner tries for.

Here I've used various pre-trained models like VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50 and Mobile NetV2 along with a basic CNN for the sole pupose of comparison

The highest accuracy being with MobileNetV2. 

The dataset that I have choosen is IDRiD, Indian Diabetic Retinopahty Dataset published in 2015.
